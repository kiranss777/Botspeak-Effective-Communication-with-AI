# **Prompt Comparison Challenge: Instructions**

### **Objective**

Practice applying the 4C’s of effective communication with AI by comparing how vague versus structured prompts affect AI output quality.

### **Materials Needed**

- Access to an AI language model (e.g., ChatGPT)
- Pen/paper or a digital document to record observations
- The three example topics provided:

  1. Electric Vehicles
  2. Time Management Tips
  3. Healthy Eating for Beginners

### **Activity Steps**

1. **Review the Prompts**
   For each topic, you have two prompts:

   - **Vague Prompt:** A general, unspecific request.
   - **Structured Prompt:** A detailed prompt incorporating the 4C’s: Context, Constraints, Content Goal, Check.

2. **Submit Prompts to AI**
   Enter each prompt (vague and structured) into the AI separately and save or copy the output.

3. **Compare the Outputs**
   For each topic, note:

   - Clarity and completeness of the AI’s response
   - Relevance to the intended audience
   - Structure, tone, and depth of content
   - Any missing or hallucinated information

4. **Fill Out the Comparison Table**
   Create a table with the following columns:

   | Topic             | Prompt Type        | Output Quality | Notes / Observations |
   | ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | -------------------- |
   | Electric Vehicles | Vague / Structured |                |                      |
   | Time Management   | Vague / Structured |                |                      |
   | Healthy Eating    | Vague / Structured |                |                      |

5. **Reflection Questions**

   - How did adding context, constraints, and content goals change the AI’s response?
   - Which output would be more useful in a real-world scenario? Why?
   - How can you improve vague prompts in your own work with AI?

### **Success Criteria**

- You successfully identify differences between vague and structured prompts.
- You demonstrate understanding of the 4C’s in your observations.
- You reflect on practical improvements you could make to prompts in the future.

### **Notes**

- No grading is required; the goal is **self-assessment and learning**.
- Try to be honest and detailed in your notes — the more you analyze, the more you’ll internalize effective AI communication strategies.

If you want, I can **also create a ready-to-use PDF template with the comparison tables and instructions**, so students can directly fill it in during the activity. Do you want me to do that next?

## **Example 1: Electric Vehicles**

**Task:** Explain the benefits of electric vehicles.

**Vague Prompt:**

> “Tell me about electric vehicles.”

**Structured Prompt:**

> “I’m a college student writing a 300-word article for a sustainability class. Please explain the benefits of electric vehicles, including environmental, economic, and social impacts. Use an academic tone and provide at least two real-world examples. Organize the content with an introduction, 2–3 key points, and a conclusion.”

---

## **Example 2: Time Management Tips**

**Task:** Provide practical time management strategies.

**Vague Prompt:**

> “Give me some time management tips.”

**Structured Prompt:**

> “I’m a busy software engineering graduate student struggling to balance coursework, part-time work, and personal projects. Please provide a 250-word guide on time management strategies, including daily scheduling, task prioritization, and avoiding procrastination. Use a friendly, actionable tone with clear bullet points and examples that I can immediately apply.”

---

## **Example 3: Healthy Eating for Beginners**

**Task:** Suggest a beginner-friendly healthy eating plan.

**Vague Prompt:**

> “How do I eat healthy?”

**Structured Prompt:**

> “I’m a 28-year-old office worker who sits most of the day and wants to improve overall health. Please create a 1-week healthy eating plan, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner ideas, with an emphasis on quick and affordable meals. Use simple, clear language suitable for a beginner and explain the benefits of each choice.”

---

**Tip for the Activity:**
Students can run all three pairs of prompts through the AI, compare outputs side-by-side, and fill in the comparison table. This way, they **see the impact of the 4C’s in multiple domains** — technology, productivity, and lifestyle.

# Evaluation Criteria: Prompt Comparison Challenge

Since this activity is self-guided, these criteria are designed to help participants **assess their own understanding** and **reflect meaningfully**.

---

## 1. Identification of Prompt Type Differences (30%)

- **Excellent (Full Understanding):** Clearly identifies how vague vs. structured prompts differ in context, constraints, content goal, and output quality.
- **Satisfactory (Partial Understanding):** Recognizes some differences but misses key aspects of the 4C’s.
- **Needs Improvement:** Struggles to differentiate between vague and structured prompts.

## 2. Output Analysis and Observation (30%)

- **Excellent:** Provides detailed notes on AI outputs, including clarity, relevance, tone, structure, and completeness. Notes show thoughtful comparison.
- **Satisfactory:** Observations are general or incomplete; some relevant differences are noted.
- **Needs Improvement:** Observations are superficial or vague; little comparison made.

## 3. Application of 4C’s Framework (20%)

- **Excellent:** Demonstrates understanding of Context, Constraints, Content Goal, and Check when analyzing outputs and suggesting improvements.
- **Satisfactory:** Shows partial understanding of the 4C’s but misses one or more elements.
- **Needs Improvement:** Fails to connect the 4C’s to the prompt or output analysis.

## 4. Reflection and Self-Improvement Insights (20%)

- **Excellent:** Reflects deeply on how prompt structure affects AI output, identifies personal improvement opportunities, and proposes actionable strategies for better prompts.
- **Satisfactory:** Some reflection present but limited insight or general observations.
- **Needs Improvement:** Little to no reflection; does not identify learning points or improvements.

## Self-Assessment Tips

- Use this as a checklist while completing the activity.
- Score yourself or mark “✔️” for each criterion you fully met.
- Focus on **learning and understanding**, not just completion.
