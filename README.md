# 🧠 Teach a Botspeak Concept — Assignment Repository

This repository contains all materials for my **Teach a Botspeak Concept (100 Points)** assignment.  
I focused on the concept of **Effective Communication with AI** within the Botspeak framework and created multi-format educational resources to demonstrate my understanding.

## 🎥 Part 3: Multi-Format Presentation

As required, I created **two distinct educational formats** (and an additional one for enrichment):

1. **Video Tutorial** — [YouTube link](somelink)

   - Explains the concept with real-world examples and visual storytelling

2. **Interactive App** — [Streamlit App: Better Prompt Maker](https://better-prompt-maker.streamlit.app)

   - Lets users practice writing and refining AI prompts with guided feedback

3. **Bonus Presentation** — Slide deck summarizing the key takeaways of _Effective Communication with AI_

## 🔍 Reflection (Brief)

My teaching approach was centered on **active engagement** rather than passive learning.

- I used **scenario-based examples** to show both effective and ineffective communication with AI.
- The **interactive app** lets learners practice prompt writing in real time.
- The **video + slides** provide visual reinforcement, ensuring accessibility across learning styles.  
  This multimodal strategy aligns with Botspeak’s principle of **collaborative fluency** between humans and AI.
