# ðŸŽ¥ Part 3: Multi-Format Presentation

As required, I created **two distinct educational formats** (and an additional one for enrichment):

1. **Video Tutorial** â€” [YouTube link](somelink)

   - Explains the concept with real-world examples and visual storytelling

2. **Interactive App** â€” [Streamlit App: Better Prompt Maker](https://better-prompt-maker.streamlit.app)

   - Lets users practice writing and refining AI prompts with guided feedback

3. **Bonus Presentation** â€” Slide deck summarizing the key takeaways of _Effective Communication with AI_
